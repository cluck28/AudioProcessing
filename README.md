# AudioProcessing
Building a versatile package to record audio and do analysis. 

Using pyaudio I am building a package to analyze various audio files. This was inspired by a desire to explore speech-to-text algorithms as music visualization. Combining these two interests has made me curious to explore automated music transcription, i.e., speech-to-text but for music.

The eventual implementation will be similar to speech-to-text algorithms where a neural network is used to map the waveform in frequency space to a note in music. Along the way I want to explore if it is possible to decompose audio files into their component instrumental sections.

This work is ongoing and I'll try to keep updated versions of the code here and a discussion of my progress at http://christopherluciuk.ca/
